# OpenCore folder for HP 15-bs026ns

OpenCore Version: 0.5.9

## What Works:

+ Integrated Graphics
+ Sound
+ Display Brightness
+ HDMI
+ Trackpad
+ Battery Indicator
+ Wi-Fi

## Work in Progress:

+ Bluetooth (doesn't load even though it's a supported card by [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware))
+ Power Management

## Notes:

+ To get Wi-Fi working you have to build [itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm)
+ You have to provide your own Resources folder as it's too big for me to upload it
